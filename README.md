RUN 0Main.py not saver.bat in order to run the program

Important:
⚠️⚠️ LOADING AND MOVING WILL BRIEFLY KILL THE WINDOWS FILE EXPORER, make sure nothing is being uploaded/downloaded/deleted/moved around as it may corrupt the data ⚠️⚠️

Changing desktops too quickly will make windows think there is something fishy going on and give you "Fatal Error Maximum Execution Time of 30 seconds" (atleast if you have lively wallpaper running)

Dependencies: Just python (current version 3.11.3)

For the sake of brevity desktop file locations (the position in which desktop files appear on the desktop) are simply called "desktops" within the software


What this software does (so far):

-Allows you to save desktop file locations (stored in "%CD%/Desktops") 
-Allows you to load desktop file locations.

Somewhat Important:

-"the registry" assumes all files are on all desktops, if a file is not accounted for it may rearrange that perticular file "a bit funny". (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)
(this can be a bit annoying if you have a "gaming" and "productivity" set up and would not like to have the games on your desktop for the second desktop)
